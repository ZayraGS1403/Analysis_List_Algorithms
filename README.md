# Time Comparison of Inserts in Different Data Structures

-------

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
is a project that implements and compares the efficiency of different data structures in Python, specifically LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, and Array, focusing on random insertion and deletion operations. The project includes tools to measure the execution times of these operations, generate random data, and visualize results in graphs for comparative analysis. This repository is ideal for students, researchers, or developers interested in algorithms and data structures.

------
## ðŸ“Š Features
Implementation of LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, and Array with random insertion and deletion methods.
Random data generation for testing the structures.
Measurement of execution times for specific operations on each structure.
Visualization of results using line and bar charts with Matplotlib.
Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.

### Install the dependencies:
``` pip install matplotlib numpy```

------
### Analyze the results
